					NMCLI IS BSD (WITHOUT DASH).


ifconfig | /sbin/ifconfig | sudo ifconfig >> is old package 
i have to download it and install it 
sudo apt install net-tools
but new one is $ip address show. is the default now in all system.
$ip address == ip address show. default is show.
$ip link show >> two or more result we will have 
1) lo:<LOOPBACK> >>> this is virsual network card. 
even if remove all netwrok card. i will still have virsual network card
and this is important i have a server and want to test something the server is listening to a network so he will listen to LOOPBACK and to see that i can ping in myself 127.0.0.1.

2) enp7s0 >> not only this name can change is depend how many way you can conect to internet with wire or wifi and even if VMWARE.
but for now enp7s0 <NO - CARRIER > Is mean ethernet (en is for ethernet)
(s0 is for slot 0) (enp7s0 ==> en ETHERNET p PORT 7  SLOT 0).
ens1 >> en ETHERNET/ s1 >> SLOT 1
eno1 >> en ETHERNET/ o1 >> onborad (built-in).

3)wl6s0 <BROADCAS> IS mean wifi . (wl is for wireless LAN).
				    (s0 is for slot 0).
we could have diffrent like (eno3 is for onboard 3).is mean on matherborad mean built in.

also MAC ADDRESS IS : link/ether 78:0c:b8:0c:bf:7a

-----------------------------------------------------------

ifconfig is old package the new one is ip address show | ip a s | ip addr sh.

if i want to see the STATISTIC >> ip -s link show wl6s0.
$ip -s link show >> will show all models.
is to show RX & TX
$ip route>> is to see the route. routing  is mean like i have my pc where he send the data go through wifi and send it to this router whois ip this.
as i understand is like you want to send data to place like london for example 
and this data need to go out from you machine or OS will go through what
ethernet or wifi and to what router

default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlp6s0 proto dhcp src 192.168.1.172 metric 600 
192.168.1.0/24 dev wlp6s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.172 metric 600 

$ cat /etc/resolve.conf>> is to get my DNS.

$nmcli (network manager cli) >> this is the new tool before they were doing all this with files to enter the file manoulay and do it now not 
just (nmcli) and chose what you want to do 
for example:
we can create a wifi profile for home and work. one for 4g and another 5 g and more let's see.

$nmcli devices status >>>

mrnext@next:~$ nmcli device status 
DEVICE          TYPE      STATE                   CONNECTION       
wlp6s0          wifi      connected               Campos Home 2.4G 
lo              loopback  connected (externally)  lo               
p2p-dev-wlp6s0  wifi-p2p  disconnected            --               
enp7s0          ethernet  unavailable             --    
what is mean is mean that we want to see ours device that is connected to system
for example we have wifi is connected to wifi name campos home.
lo is alwyas connected to be alwasys connected.
the other is not like ethernet or other.


mrnext@next:~$ nmcli connection show 
NAME                UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE 
Campos Home 2.4G    57939af3-c099-4a3a-91cb-f7a8c0943169  wifi      wlp6s0 
lo                  875f19b6-fb8f-4635-bc05-8d34867935f1  loopback  lo     
Madrid              fd676ea4-3721-4c9e-8374-4601db60fc59  wifi      --     
Privato             1cbbb6a8-afa5-4f5d-8e67-22b0ebb6cb17  wifi      --     
Wired connection 1  3988cee5-7e73-3174-93cd-9f81e4913369  ethernet  --  

is almost same with nmcli device status why becz device show show me all device is connected and the status and here also is telling me whice device is in
connection yes not all device only who is connected and not just that is also
show me what connection i did before Madrid is wifi i did before Privato is my
hotspot from my phone and right connection campos.

is almost all of them same 
nmcli connection show == device status 

and this will show me all connection but if i want more information about a specific 
connection easy just
nmcli connection show (name of the network).




and every device from this has a profile for example if we chose privato 
i alwas use 5g from my phone to laptop and Madrid is 5g also and campos 2.4g
so every connection has a profile and we can see that how down.

$nmcli connection show (name of device: Madrid, Privato, campos home)
$nmcli connection show Madrid. i will see 186 option and i can edit all of them
like what this  option for example autoconect wifi id and more more.
ALSO WE CAN SEE THEM HOW 
$nmcli connectoin add TAP
mrnext@next:~$ nmcli connection add 
Display all 117 possibilities? (y or n)
IMPORTANT NOTE NOW IS 117 BEFORE WAS LESS SO IS DEPEND ON YOUR SYSTEM.

let's try to make a profile for example:
$nmcli connection add con-name (network name) argument with BSD syntacs.

mrnext@next:~$ nmcli connection add con-name hassnwifi type wifi ifname wlp6s0 autoconnect yes ssid "1234"

and if we nmcli connection show we will find our new hassanwifi connection. and we can connected anytime 
(((((((((((((((((((((( BETTER PROFILE ))))))))))))))))))
$nmcli connection add con-name "HASSAN HOME WIFI" type wifi ifname wlp6s0 autoconnect yes ssid "Campos Home 2.4G" wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk wifi-sec.psk "0xf2bf067c24"

con-name >>> any name i want to set just me make me what profile i am using 
ifname >>> to choce what device i will select wifi or ethernet or what is connected to my machine.(interface name).	kj
autconnect is mean if reboot this profile we be up automaticaly.
ssid >>> is the name of the network that i will connect.
wiif-sec.keymgmt >>> type of the connection is wap1/2/3/4.
wifi-sec.psk>>> the password if the network not requeired wifi not need to set wifi-sec.psk

and now we can see our profile from 
$nmcli connection show oooooorrrrr nmcli connection show "HASSAN HOME WIFI" orrrrrrrrrrrrr nmcli device show wlp6s0

now we know how to add a connection NEW to edit we will do nmcli connection modify (network name ) TAP to see option.


after creating the profile i want to connect my internet so up to connect and down to disconnect
$nmcli connection up/down  (profile name)


THERE ARE MANY OTHER OPTIOONS ALSO IMPORTANT TAB TO SEE.

all this information saved in a file to access this file 

$cat/nano/vim (use sudo to not get access denied) /etc/NetworkManager/system-connection/(all profiles will be here).

i tried to check in my system but i could not find. CHATGPT >> ??

$hostname 
next
to change hostname
$hostname "new name"
but will be temperiory or Transient hostname: hello
and if restart my system will be avalible anymore
to see the manager or hostname
$hostnamectl >> i will see all information about my device machine.
and to set hostname for ever even after reboot.
$hostnamectl set-hostname "new name"

also i can change all this with GUI nmcli
HOW?
$nmtui (network manager text user interface).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how to ping >> ping is like to conect to a specifi ip to see if will replay or avalible or not
ping (ip) / ping 19.4.56.2 >> but will ping for ever if i add -c4 it will ping  4 times only i want 6 >> ping (ip) -c6.


also there ss what is ss?

ss  is used to dump socket statistics. It allows showing information similar to netstat.  It can display more TCP and
state information than other tools.

also there is something called tracepath >>
