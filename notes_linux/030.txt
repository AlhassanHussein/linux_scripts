gzip >> faster but bad compressing
bzipz >> meduim speed but better compressing
xz >> slow speed but best compressing

who to use?
compressing 			decompressing

gzip file.gz			gzip -d file.gz (gunzip file.gz)
bzip2 file.bz2			bzip2 -d file.bz2 (bunzip2 file.bz2)
xz file.xz 			xz -d file.xz (unxz file.xz)

we can use (time) function to know what time it take.
for example:

time xz file.txt   || time xz -d file.txt.xz.
-d: decompressing
-k: keep input file
-f: force and overwirete if the file exits.
-z: is default to compressing.
-v: verbose.

------------------------------------------
tar || archiving >>> is mean if you have a directory and this dir have 
alot of files every file will take one inode so maybe wtih time you wont
find enough inode maybe you have space but you do not have inode plus
you want to copy this dir with archiving is more faster.
so is usful to save inode and save time for copy or move.

HOW TO USE: 

tar -c new_file.tar file_want_to_archive.tar
tar -x file_want_to_dearchive.tar
options:
-f: file
-c: create tar
-x extract tar
-t: list all tar you have in a dir path
-v: verbose

IMPORTANT NOTE:
-cfv != -cvf 
remember always -f comes after the file name so it must be -cvf file_name.tar
also if i extracte  without sudo all files be belong to me as owner 
so must be with sudo becz he have the power to chage the owner value also group owner.
| Command                     | Resulting Ownership               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `tar -xf` (as user)         | Files owned by **you**            |
| `sudo tar -xf`              | Files owned by **original users** |
| `sudo tar --same-owner -xf` | Ensures original ownership        |


----------------------ARCHIVE & COMPRESS ONE COMMAND--------------
sudo tar -czf etc_dd.tar.gz /etc/
sudo tar -cjf etc_dd.tar.bz2 /etc/
sudo tar -cJf etc_dd.tar.xz /etc/

z: gzip
j: bzip2
J: xz
to extracte the archive and compress eassy
sodo tar -xzf etc_dd.tar.xz >> x to extracte and decompress.
