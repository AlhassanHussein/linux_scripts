-------------------------------------------------	SSH ------------------------------------

before they were using telnet and it was a way to transfer the data between the clinet and server 
but not encrypted so it was easy to get the data information during trafic

but now they made SSH >> and he using diffi hellman it's a way to use encryption that almost imposable to be hacked
to get the data it's easy and diffcult to study but not importnat in linux just for knoweldge.

to use ssh >>> it's a package if not installed download it openssh-server (sudo apt install openssh-server).

mrnext@ubuntu:~$ systemctl status ssh
○ ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)
TriggeredBy: ● ssh.socket
       Docs: man:sshd(8)
             man:sshd_config(5)


>>> is enabled also preset is mean the default of this package. but is inactive so we need to active it. how ??
$systemctl start ssh.
mrnext@ubuntu:~$ systemctl status ssh

=============================================

now let's connect to another system usign ssh
to get the ip addres where i want to connect $ip address show OR ip -br address show will get only ip not much information.

mrnext@ubuntu:~$ ip -br a s
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128 
enp7s0           DOWN           
wlp6s0           UP             192.168.238.129/24 fe80::670:2f74:4023:d6c5/64 

to connect to another machine.

$ssh username@ip_address (by default will go out through port 22 if i want to chage -p 2222 ) or any port i can put after -p.
if it fist time  will ask me to save the fingerprint if yes>> won't ask me again 

now i could connet between to system through ssh.

if i look my home profile i will see a hidden folder not file (.ssh).
inside this folder we will see files it is were ssh saves the fingerprint (((( i belive every device save 3 things or keys)).
why this is important>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

| File                                | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `known_hosts`                       | Stores fingerprints of servers you've connected to |
| `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`              | Your private SSH keys                              |
| `id_rsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub`      | Your public SSH keys                               |
| `authorized_keys` *(on the server)* | Allows login if your public key is listed here     |


let's say we have a server and only me admin who connect to this server and server save my fingerprint about me or my laptop
and there is a hacker he want to connect to the system. so your system will send you alert someone trying to connect to 
the server is not in fingerprint.

all this we will connect with the password but what if i want to connect just like that easy i mean to save my fingerprint and my password in the server that not every time i connect to enter the password we will do it how ???

we will create public id for us and copy it to the server let's see how.


let's create key for us
$ssh-keygen ((( ssh will generate a key for us with RSA this is default we can change $ssh-keyget -t dsa (DSA)
then wil ask me where to save the key default is ~/.ssh/
then will ask me about the passphrase >>>> and this is like a password to put it when i connect i can leave empty and not write.

then we will see our id public we generated now in ~/.ssh

now we will copy it to the server let's see how.

$ssh-copy-id (username if i didnot give will take mine as default mrnext but must be there also mrnext )@ip address of the servr

some issues will appear
if the folder .ssh not created i have to created before also and change chmod to group and other i do not know why but GPT.

now if we try to connect normal it should not ask the password but he ask me hahahahha so WTF.

the issue is about RWX i had to check the folder owner and it was the root so it must be the same user i am connecting it
also the file 

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


and is not ncessery to login to server just to run one command no i can do this 

mrnext@ubuntu:~/.ssh$ ssh serverUser@192.168.238.139 hostname
snnext2

==========================================================================


			NOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT CONFIGRATION .config

mrnext@ubuntu:/etc/ssh$ ls
moduli      ssh_config.d  sshd_config.d       ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub  ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub  ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
ssh_config  sshd_config   ssh_host_ecdsa_key  ssh_host_ed25519_key    ssh_host_rsa_key          ssh_import_id

we have two importnat config files one for server and one for client 
client file >> ssh_config
server file >> sshd_config (sshd)

server file we can custmozied as we want for example if we want to 
change the port from default 22 to 2222 or chocie only one network who can connect to me.
and more options

in the video said if we change any things in server file sshd_config i have to reload or to restart 
but CHATGPT said reload is not avalibale anymore becz it dedect automaticaly. let's check.

i change the port from 22 to 2222 now to check is the port changed or we have to restart 
we have a command called (ss) is like netstat 

is true i have to restart to reload 

mrnext@ubuntu:/etc/ssh$ ss -tulpen | grep ssh
tcp   LISTEN 0      4096               *:22               *:*    ino:12508 sk:1006 cgroup:/system.slice/ssh.socket v6only:0 <->                                          
as i see it did not update let's see if we can reload.

$systemctl reload sshd.service >> this is reload the service 
i tried but did not reload the port maybe restart.
even restart did not reload the config file.

i will try to connect from another system and see maybe is realoed it but not appear in ss -tulpean

well did not work give me connection refused becz i put ssh -p 2222 ..... so the port is true did not reload yet.

i did something i had to stop and disable ssh.socket >> systemctl (stop/disable) ssh.socket
and it work and i connect but how ???


so the solution is to stop and disable the ssh.socket and open it again this will reload the port.

okay know i understand all 

i am trying to change the port in /etc/ssh/sshd_config (server file) using vim. 
when i do ss -tulpen to see the port i see not update so what i have to do i have 
to stop/disable ssh.socket and then open it again.
but this won't happen until i stop sshd.service.


small note:

we have a file .config 
where we change the port
there is also something called premetroot i do not remember but it's talking about 
if you put (no) is mean what ever happen the root will never login from any client only local 
will be the root in case someone know the root password can login remotely and do HACKS.
